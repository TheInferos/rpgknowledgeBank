        var result = 'Acrobatics (Advanced, Movement)<br>Stat: Agility <br>Useful for the Acolyte on the move, Acrobatics can be used in numerous situations to negate obstacles and circumvent treacherous conditions. Acrobatics can also provide a definitive edge when facing less agile foes. <br>Hot Pursuit <br>Normally, chasing after an opponent or fleeing from a pursuer is an Opposed Agility Test. To the acrobatic Acolyte, however, the environment can be a valuable tool, an advantage that allows the Acolyte to leap over railings, run along aerial walkways, jump across rooftops and careen down staircases. Whenever you are engaged in a pursuit through a congested area—crowds, difficult terrain, and so on, you may make an Acrobatics Test (in place of your Agility Test) for the Opposed Test. <br>Negotiating Obstacles <br>To a skilled acrobat, every obstacle is an opportunity, and every obstruction a challenge instead of a barrier. Whenever you Charge or Run through treacherous terrain or through an area containing an obstacle, you may make an Acrobatics Test in place of an Agility Test to avoid falling Prone. You may also attempt an Acrobatics Test as a Free Action prior to moving at your normal rate through treacherous environments (but not environments made treacherous because of poor visibility). <br>Tumbling Evasion <br>When engaged with an opponent, you may Test Acrobatics to disengage as a Half Action instead of a Full Action. A successful Test allows you to move as if you had taken a Half Move Action without granting your opponent a free attack (see Fleeing in Dark Heresy on page 192). A failed Test means you still move, but your opponent gets a free attack with a +10 bonus.<br><br>Pursuits <br>At some time a character is bound to find himself involved in a chase, pursuing or being pursued by unfriendly heretics. This can be a thrilling component to roleplaying games, especially those involving dangerous environments, but such encounters can be a chore to run. To resolve pursuit simply, use the following rules. <br>A Pursuit Dissected <br>All pursuits occur in Detailed Time, so participants roll for Initiative and move as described in Dark Heresy. Where pursuit differs from normal combat encounters is in the tracking of Pursuit Points. After rolling for Initiative, the character that acts first gains 1 Pursuit Point. On their Turn, each character involved in the pursuit, may take normal Actions (such as shooting at the fleeing opponent or pursuer, using a power, and so on). Alternatively, the character can Chase or Flee by making an Agility Test. The GM assigns the Difficulty based on the environment, with open areas being Easy (+30), while a densely packed marketplace would be Very Hard (–30). A success equals 1 Pursuit Point plus 1 Pursuit Point for each degree of success. A failure reduces the number of Pursuit Points by 1 and by another 1 point for a failure by two or more degrees. A failure by four or more degrees, reduces the Pursuit Points by 1d5. A character with negative Pursuit Points is effectively out of the chase or, for the fleeing character, pulled out of the chase. The first character to accumulate 10 Pursuit Points gets away or catches their prey, depending on who’s doing the chasing or fleeing. <br>Example <br>Karl runs away from a pair of drugged-up gangers who want his stylish boots. Karl’s player rolls Initiative as normal (1d10+AB) and the GM rolls Initiative for the gang members (1d10+AB). Karl wins the Initiative, so he gains 1 Pursuit Point. On his Turn, he flees, so he Tests Agility. The GM rules that the streets are lightly congested, so the Test is Challenging (+0). Karl succeeds on the Test and gains a degree of success, netting him 2 more Pursuit Points for a total of 3. The gang members follow and Test Agility. The GM should Test them separately, which he does, with one succeeding and one failing, so one of the gang members falls behind. The other only succeeded, so he has just 1 Pursuit Point to Karl’s 3. The chase continues over a number of Rounds until either Karl or the gang member achieves 10 Pursuit Points or until one breaks off the chase. <br>Slowing Pursuit <br>If you’re being chased, you can slow your pursuers by creating obstacles. There must be something to use—a crate of bottles, boxes, barrels, people and so on. Creating an obstacle reduces the number of Pursuit Points you would earn for a successful Agility Test in the Round by 1, however, you increase the Difficulty of your pursuers’ Agility Tests by one-step. <br>Distance <br>While these pursuit rules are somewhat abstracted, actual distance is covered. For each Round of pursuit, the participants cover a number of metres equal to their Run movement.';

A successful Barter Test and each degree of success beyond, grants you a +5 bonus on your next Interaction Test against your target made within a number of days equal to your Fellowship Bonus.

A Blather Test is always Opposed by your target’s Willpower (or Scrutiny). If you succeed and the target fails, the target is distracted by you and can do nothing for one Round, staring dumbfounded and wondering if you are drunk, crazy or both. For every degree of success, you dumbfound the target for an additional Round. If your target succeeds and you fail, or if you both fail, your attempt at verbal acrobatics fails and the target may act normally. In the case where you both succeed, the character that had the most degrees of success determines the outcome. You can also use Blather against multiple opponents. For similar opponents—those that have the same general Characteristics—make a Blather Test as normal, but the GM rolls just one Willpower Test. If you win the Opposed Test, you affect a number of targets equal to your Fellowship Bonus. NPCs, while confused by your banter, are unaffected by your words if they are in obvious danger or if it is clear there are preparations being made to harm them. The target must understand the language you are speaking or the Test automatically fails—you cannot, for instance, use this Skill against animals. A Blather Test is a Full Action.';

Drinking Contests: A drinking contest, whether in the form of a competition to drink alcohol the fastest or to be the last man standing, is simply an Opposed Carouse Test.

A successful Test can make friends out of foes, bank the fires of anger and get you into places where the bullet would otherwise fail. Compel: You can convince a target to do something they otherwise might not do by laying it on thick with flattery or encouragement. You can compel the target, effectively improving his Disposition by two-steps instead of the normal one-step, by accepting a –20 penalty to your Charm Test. The target does as you ask, but afterwards he is entitled to an Intelligence Test to realise he has been used. If he succeeds, his Disposition worsens by three steps. On a failed Charm Test to compel, the target’s Disposition drops by one-step. First Impressions First impressions last, as the old Imperial adage goes, and it will do you well to keep this in mind as you make your way through the universe. When you first encounter a character, you may make a Charm Test to leave them with a positive impression, making subsequent Interaction Skill Tests one step easier until you fail a Skill Test or commit some breach of etiquette or social blunder. Of course, if you fail this Test your attempt has the opposite effect, making Interaction Skill Tests one-step more difficult';

        var result = 'Chem-Use (Advanced, Investigation)<br>Stat:Intelligence<br>The life of an Acolyte is one fraught with peril, with hidden dangers everywhere as enemies of the Imperium do their best to survive under the oppressive weight of the Inquisition. Since many foes lack the firepower to mount significant opposition against the agents of the Inquisition, many resort to cowardly tactics in the forms of poisons, toxins and other vile substances to confuse, injure or kill their enemies. Chem-Use, then, can serve as the first line of defence against these vile weapons, while also giving the Acolyte the tools to concoct filthy brews of his own./nAlien Toxins: From the unholy cocktails imbued with the warp by Chaos cultists to the strange and lethal venom of the Tyranids, the galaxy brims with an appalling assortment of venoms and poisons, all of which are available if you know the right place to look. Normally, when you encounter a toxin, you may Test Chem-Use to identify it (see Detecting Poisons). If you fail this Test, you may still use the toxin, but the Difficulty worsens by two-steps.<br>Concealing Poisons<br> Whenever you want to introduce a toxin into a target’s food, drink or air and want to conceal your activity, you may make a Difficult (–10) Chem-Use Test to administer the chemical in a way the victim may not detect. On a success, you apply the poison normally. However, for each degree of success, you worsen the Difficulty of the Chem-Use Test made later to identify the toxin from the victim’s remains. More Than Human: Unnatural Characteristics, Test and Skills Explained Certain creatures and antagonists have the Unnatural Characteristic trait representing a superhuman level of ability in one or more areas. Each Unnatural trait has a multiplier illustrating just how great the ability is (×2, ×3, etc.) which applies in the following ways: The Characteristic Bonus is the first digit of their Characteristic score multiplied by the amount in brackets. For example: an Ogryn with Unnatural Strength (×2) and a Strength Characteristic of 43, would have a Strength Bonus of 8 (4×2=8). Note that Unnatural Agility whilst increasing the AB, does not affect the creature’s Move Rate—this is a separate Trait, Unnatural Speed (see Dark Heresy page 333). When taking a Skill Test based upon a Characteristic with the Unnatural trait, the base Difficulty of the Test is staged downwards one level for degree of multiplier past normal (to maximum of +30), For example: the Archmagos Voltaic has a Dark Age of Technology cortical implant giving him Unnatural Intelligence (×3). He is called on to repair a damaged plasma core using his Intelligence based Tech Use skill. Normally this would be a Very Hard (–30) Test, but thanks to his Unnatural Intelligence the Difficulty is reduced by two stages to Difficult (–10), (–1 stage for ×2, and –1 for ×3). During Opposed Characteristic Tests, where success is achieved, the Unnatural multiplier is added to the degrees of success. In the case of a tie, the participant without the Unnatural Characteristic trait loses the Opposed Test. For example: Garm Felbood is struggling with a tentacled monstrosity from the swamps of Dusk. Garm has Strength 40 and the thing from the swamp has Strength 33 (Unnatural (×2)). Garm rolls 20 (two degrees of success) and the thing rolls 30 (straight success), unfortunately the thing adds +2 degrees of success because of its (×2) modifier, bringing the Opposed Test to a draw. This translates to a victory to the swamp thing as it has Unnatural Strength and poor old Garm does not!<br>Detecting Poisons: You may use Chem-Use when analysing the remains of a victim to detect toxins and chemicals buried in the flesh. Provided you have a toxin wand or a chemistry lab, a successful Chem-Use Test reveals the absence or presence of such a substance. Each degree of success reveals one more component of the substance, including such things as what it is, its method of delivery, and the most likely places where it can be procured. If you lack proper equipment, you take a –20 penalty on your Chem-Use Test. Other factors can modify the Difficulty, including the quality of the remains, attempts to mask the substance chemically, or even the nature of the substance itself.';

Ciphers is the ability to communicate in a specific code, a language developed by a group to conceal the contents of their conversations. Many Inquisitors develop their own Ciphers to communicate their instructions to their Acolytes, while also giving a vital tool for use between their servants while on missions. Whilst the Skill Groups for this Skill are quite broad, you can make them more specific, effectively creating sub-groups for each sub-skill. When using the Ciphers skill to discern or translate the meaning of the code of which you do not actually know, but is within a Skill Group for which you are trained, you may Test Ciphers normally, but at a –20 penalty.<br>Countermeasures<br>When a cipher is cracked by the enemy, it usually means bad news for those groups who rely on it, leading to misinformation and signs laid by the enemy that lead them into traps. If you suspect that your cipher has been cracked or that someone is using it to feed you bad information, you may make a Cipher Test opposed by your opponent’s Cipher Test. Success indicates that you have worked out that something is wrong, giving you the opportunity to turn the tables on your opponent. Failure indicates that you are none the wiser to the subterfuge. The GM always rolls both sides of the Opposed Test in secret to avoid tipping you off that something is up.<br>Deciphering a Cipher<br>Once you have identified a cipher, the meaning remains hidden unless it can first be deciphered. The easiest way to decipher a cipher is to capture someone who already knows its meaning and then persuade them to reveal its secrets. Otherwise, the task becomes a lot harder, requiring days of painstaking code cracking and number crunching, and even then you may only be able to decipher this particular message and not crack the entire cipher. Cracking a cipher is an Investigation Test with a Hard benchmark, meaning that Tests to overcome it are at a –20 penalty. The process takes one month. You may use raw Intelligence, or your Logic or Scholastic Lore (Cryptology) as the Investigation Skill. Successfully interrogating or bribing someone who knows the code may reduce the benchmark of the investigation or negate the need for a roll at all.';

A character that learns the Forbidden Lore skill in play, or who uses it to gain some insight into the mysteries of the galaxy, may also gain a number of Corruption or Insanity Points, depending on the danger the knowledge represents, at the GM’s discretion. The Black Library: Secret know-ledge of the Black Library, its forbidden contents, strange industries and the unspeakable pale, hairless things that toil within its walls. Cults: Knowledge of the most notorious Imperial Cults and some of their sub-sects and splinter cabals. Daemonology: Terrible comprehension of some of the recorded warp entities and their various manifestations. Heresy: Unpleasant appreciation for those acts and practices deemed heretical by the Imperium. Inquisition: A general understanding (often based on hearsay and rumour) of that most terrible and secret of organisations known as the Inquisition. Archeotech: Knowledge of the great tech devices of ancient times and clues to their function and purpose. Mutants: Covering the study of both stable and unstable mutations and some of their more unfortunate results. Ordos: Either Malleus, Hereticus or Xenos and granting some slightly more specialised knowledge of that particular ordo’s practices. Adeptus Mechanicus: An understanding of the followers of theMachine God, including such things as their observances, common beliefs and core philosophies. Psykers:  Skill in identifying the signs of psykers as well as the results of their powers and the extent of their capabilities. Warp: An understanding of the ways of the warp, especially its interaction with real space and how its tides and eddies can affect travel between the stars. Xenos: Knowledge of the most commonly encountered species of aliens within the Imperium. Using Forbidden Lore takes no time at all. You either know something or you do not, although the consequences for knowing such things can last a lifetime…. <br>Forbidden Goods <br>You may make a Forbidden Lore Test instead of an Evaluate Test, to calculate the (often priceless) value of a forbidden artefact or try to learn something about its history or purpose. Of course, peddling forbidden artefacts is often treated as a worse crime than simply possessing them, usually ending in execution... or worse. <br>Forbidden Procedures <br>A little knowledge can be a dangerous thing when dealing with forbidden lore, but can still ingratiate you with an organisation all the quicker.

Medicae enables you to patch up comrades, pull an ally from the brink of death, administer drugs and point out the best place to stick a needle to cause optimum pain. Diagnose You can diagnose what’s wrong with a patient by succeeding on a Medicae Test. The GM rolls for you in secret. A success reveals the most basic trouble, with each degree of success revealing an additional useful fact. A failure reveals nothing, while a failure by three or more degrees results in a misdiagnosis with often spectacularly awful results if the physician is allowed to treat the patient. Examples include poisoning, lopping off the incorrect limb, replacing organs unnecessarily and so on. First Aid As described in Dark Heresy, First Aid is one of the most common uses of the Medicae skill in that it allows you to treat an injured companion quickly, by staunching his wounds and getting him back on his feet. The amount of Damage removed with a First Aid Test depends on the Injury Level of the patient as shown on the following table: Injury Level Damage Removed Light Intelligence Bonus Heavy 1 point Critical 1 point Generally, a Medicae Test to provide First Aid is Challenging (+0), but the severity as well as the type of injury can also have an effect. As an optional rule, you can use the following Difficulties for performing First Aid on injured characters. This method requires players to keep track of the type of Damage they’ve taken. As well, a Medicae Test is made to repair a specific set of injuries, each Test attending to a particular type of injuries. The Injury Level applies to total Damage taken, so even if the target only took 1 point of Energy Damage and 6 points of Explosive Damage, that same target would still count as Heavily Injured. <br>Limits on First Aid: If you’re not using the optional rules described here, a character can benefit from First Aid just once per combat encounter, even when attended by multiple healers. If you’re using the optional rules, a character can receive First Aid for each type of Damage taken. So a character who has taken only Explosive Damage can only receive First Aid once, while a character who has taken Energy and Explosive Damage could received two uses of First Aid, one for each set of injuries <br>Other Uses <br>A person trained in Medicae can also attend to other injuries beyond Damage. <br>Blood Loss: A Difficult (–10) Medicae Test halts Blood Loss. If the subject is still fighting or has moved while suffering from Blood Loss, the Test is Very Hard (–30) instead. <br>Broken Limbs: A Difficult (–10) Medicae Test is required to safely remove a necrotised limb (which results from a failed Toughness Test made to resist limb loss from a broken limb). A failed Test deals 1d10 points of Damage to the limb location, ignoring Armour. Note that a failed Test also results in Blood Loss. <br>Install Implants and Bionic Components The Medicae skill also allows you the ability to install replacement limbs and organs. To do so, you must have the implant or bionic device handy. The Test Difficulty depends on the unit, its quality and the facilities available. The process of implantation always takes 2d10 days minus one day per point of the patient’s Toughness Bonus (to a minimum of one day). The following table describes the Test Difficulties for this procedure. All Difficulties are cumulative. If you have also have the Tech-Use skill, you gain a +10 bonus on Medicae Tests to install implants and bionic components.<br>Failed Tests <br>A failed Medicae Test to install an implant or bionic unit can have nasty consequences. A simple failure reduces the quality of the unit by one-step. If the unit was poor to begin with, the unit doesn’t work at all and could, in the case of a vital system, kill the patient. A failure by three or more degrees means that the limb breaks and the procedure seriously injures the patient, dealing 2d10 points of Rending Damage to the affected location (ignoring Armour Points). A failure by five or more degrees results in the death of the patient, the ruin of the device and 1d10 Insanity Points to all who witness the appalling mishap. <br>Extended Care <br>Extended care is covered in detail in Dark Heresy. However, if you are using the optional rules described under First Aid, the type of injury can affect the Medicae Test to treat patients. Use the predominant Damage type to determine the base Difficulty (e.g. the type of Damage that affects the target the most). In the case of two equal Damage types, use the worst modifier. Next, for each Damage type that afflicts the target beyond the first, reduce the Difficulty by one-step. This determines the base Difficulty of the Test. Unlike the system described in Dark Heresy, you must Test separately for each patient.<br>Pharmacy When administering a drug or treating a poison with Chem-Use, you may first make a Difficult (–10) Medicae Test to bring to bear your Medicae knowledge.

The Wrangling skill also allows you to care for and control domesticated animals, like bloodhounds, Spike Pigs, horses, Grox and the like. Routine care and feeding requires no Test. Tests are most commonly made to spot developing illnesses or signs of discomfort, or for special grooming (preparing a mount for a parade, for instance).Wrangling can also be used to train animals to perform tricks and obey simple commands. Properly training an animal takes some time. Tests should be made once a week during training. A simple trick can be learned with one successful Test, a moderately difficult trick can be learned with three successful Tests and a difficult trick can be learned with ten successful Tests. Common tricks include guarding, fetching, attacking, and so on. You may also use this Skill to befriend animals. Domestic animals are always friendly to you. Wild animals or those trained to be hostile (like attack dogs) can be calmed with a successful Test. GMs may impose penalties for particularly loyal or ornery animals. Wrangling is of no use against cyber-animals such as familiars, even if they are built to resemble an animal. A Wrangling Test takes a variable amount of time, depending on what the character is attempting to accomplish. Training an animal takes at least a week of hard work, whereas attempting to befriend an animal is a Full Action.<br>Riding Animals <br>Any animal that’s been trained can be ridden without having to Test Wrangling. You simply climb onto the mount (a Half Action) and ride off into the “setting suns”. Should the animal be unfriendly (i.e. it has not been trained), odds are that if you manage to get into the saddle, you won’t stay there for long. To calm such an animal so you can ride it, you must make a Wrangling Test with a Difficulty depending on the beast’s Disposition (set by the GM and accounting for your appearance, the animal’s mood and the circumstances of the encounter). On a successful Test, you may climb up and ride. On a failure, the beast objects and tries to throw you off, requiring a Difficult (–10) Agility Test. If you pass, you may attempt another Wrangling Test, otherwise you are thrown off (flying 1d5 meters in a random direction). To gain control over an uncontrolled beast, you must succeed on a number of Wrangling Tests equal to the mount’s Willpower Bonus.
